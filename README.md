# Mastering-Ansible
This is a repo to go along with the Mastering Ansible course on Udemy

https://www.udemy.com/mastering-ansible

The main reason this repo exist is due to me not follwing the course per base setup. I choose to use virtualbox with cento7-minimal-images. This serves as a record for me and anyone else that stumbles on to this repo who may run in to issues with the lab work since we had to be diffrent ;-)
